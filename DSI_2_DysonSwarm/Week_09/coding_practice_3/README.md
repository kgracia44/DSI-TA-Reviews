Given a non-negative integer ```num```, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given ```num = 38```, the process is: ```3 + 8 = 11```, ```1 + 1 = 2```. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

###Challenge:
First, solve it using any method.

Then, try solving it using recursion.

Finally, there's a solution that doesn't require either loops or recursion.

As always, you could probably find the answer if you Googled the question long enough. See if you can solve it on your own.
